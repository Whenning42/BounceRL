- Clean-up:
    - Document Cython setup
    - Check if recognition model has an inference mode that uses less VRAM
    - Fix window open reparenting crash

- Harness Features:
    ✓ Extend image capture to support offset capture regions
    ✓ Move image capture into a harness library
    ✓ Migrate harness launcher from using app configs to run configs

- Refactoring:
    ✓ Add model_lib to project.

- Reward:
    ✓ Implement the reward agent config defined in run_configs.py
    - Train a faster inferencing speed detection model
    - Evaluate the various binary classifiers for expected performance (validation error and its variance with generalization in mind)
        - Collect ~100 more positive is_reverse and is penalized samples and ~50 more negatives
        - Extend eval script to support viewing sample accuracy distribution over time
        - Extend eval script to support training with multiple seeds and offsets (We want to see mean validation error and 10th percentile validation error)

- Reinforcement learning:
    ✓ Implement the initial env
    ✓ Find a solid blackbox RL algorithm
        ✓ PPO seems to be working fine
    - Implement env.reset()

- Cool tangents:
    - It'd be nice to have a tool that makes moving files safer and easier
    - It'd be nice to have an interactive plot of sample errors so I could view the actual errors
