## MC Text Extraction
# Harness House Cleaning
✓   1. Fix exit handler
✓   2. Make program launching more general
✓   3. Get MC to float on launch
✓   4. Work on a dev console impl
✓   5. Switch to run config files
✓   6. Switch to integer observation keys
-   7. WIP: Design a dataset data format
✓   8. Record MC debug info dataset
✓   9. Design crop and binarization ops/views
✓  10. Materialize the cropped and binarized MC debug info datset

# MC Debug Text Extraction
✓  11. Implement CSV label parsing
✓  12. Implement CV2 letter extraction
✓  13. Design a compound template solution
         Either use template matching before segmentation or post-process the segmentations
         We're going to use a segment post-processing technique which gives the following algorithm:
           For all labeled templates, extract their segments.
           Then, for any extracted segment try matching the window around the segment to any labeled templates.
✓  14. Segment consolidation/deduplication
✓  15. Convert segments to annotation requests
✓  16. Gather requested annotations

# MC Text Workflows and Line Extraction
✓  17. Document the various required workflows
✓  18. Capture the existing workflow in ops_conf.py
✓  19. Implement a workflow that uses annotated templates to label all dataset characters
✓  20. Crop labeled dataset to specific interesting lines
✓  21. Implement LTR single line extraction
✓  22. Extract the required numbers

## MC Mapping
-  1. Add FPS tracking to image capture
-  2. Create an ROS camera source from image capture
-  3. Collect a 60fps minecraft camera calibration dataset
-  4. Collect a 60fps minecraft scene dataset
-  5. Run and evaluate ORB_SLAM3 on minecraft scene data

# Possible Next Steps
-  Verify extracted pos and dir data
-  Add regression tests:
-      E2E test for label and request configuration outputs
-  Clean up code:
-      Simplify existing workflow stages
-  Data Gathering:
-      Create an optical flow dataset
-      Try existing slam on MC dataset
-      Try existing optical flow on MC dataset
-
-  Other projects:
-      Create a Skyrogue dataset
-      Create an Art of Rally dataset
-      Create a dataset DB
-
-  Continuation:
-      Work on MC SLAM
-
-  Code health:
-      Clean up existing codebase
-      Explore Julia, Lisp, or C++ porting potential
