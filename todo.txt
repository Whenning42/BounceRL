- Priority:
    - Get harness/art_of_rally running as a gym env and connect to SB3 agent.

- Clean-up:
    - Document Cython setup
    - Check if recognition model has an inference mode that uses less VRAM
    - Fix window open reparenting crash

- Harness Features:
    ✓ Extend image capture to support offset capture regions
    ✓ Move image capture into a harness library
    ✓ Migrate harness launcher from using app configs to run configs

- Refactoring:
    - Add model_lib to project.

- Reward:
    ✓ Implement the reward agent config defined in run_configs.py
    - Evaluate the various binary classifiers for expected performance (validation error and its variance with generalization in mind)
        - Collect ~100 more positive is_reverse and is penalized samples and ~50 more negatives
        - Extend eval script to support viewing sample accuracy distribution over time
        - Extend eval script to support training with multiple seeds and offsets (We want to see mean validation error and 10th percentile validation error)

- Reinforcement learning:
    - Figure out what pieces we need:
        - Actions, State, and Rewards need to be handed to agent controller
        - Need to implement the agent controller (Schedules epoch learning)
        - Do we need an env reset option? (Only once the AI can win)
        - Need to find a good implementation of a blackbox RL algorithm

- Cool tangents:
    - It'd be nice to have a tool that makes moving files safer and easier
    - It'd be nice to have an interactive plot of sample errors so I could view the actual errors
