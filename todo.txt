# Harness House Cleaning
✓   1. Fix exit handler
✓   2. Make program launching more general
✓   3. Get MC to float on launch
✓   4. Work on a dev console impl
✓   5. Switch to run config files
✓   6. Switch to integer observation keys
-   7. WIP: Design a dataset data format
✓   8. Record MC debug info dataset
✓   9. Design crop and binarization ops/views

# MC Debug Text Extraction
✓  11. Implement CSV label parsing
✓  12. Implement CV2 letter extraction
✓  13. Design a compound template solution
         Either use template matching before segmentation or post-process the segmentations
         We're going to use a segment post-processing technique which gives the following algorithm:
           For all labeled templates, extract their segments.
           Then, for any extracted segment try matching the window around the segment to any labeled templates.
-  14. Segment deduplication in extractions?
