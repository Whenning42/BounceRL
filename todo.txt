- Clean-up:
    - Document Cython setup
    - Fix window open reparenting crash

✓ Harness Features:
    ✓ Extend image capture to support offset capture regions
    ✓ Move image capture into a harness library
    ✓ Migrate harness launcher from using app configs to run configs

✓ Reward:
    ✓ Implement the reward agent config defined inapp_configs.py
    ✓ Train a faster inferencing speed detection model

- Performance:
    ✓ Implement parallel envs
    - Implement frame length tracking to understand and verify perf across machines
        - See libframetime on github for an implementation/reference.

- Experiment Setup:
    - Enable running config sweeps w/ multiple trials
    - Automated launch and gather across machines

- Reinforcement learning:
    ✓ Implement the initial env
    ✓ Try out blackbox algorithm
    ✓ Fix reward function reverse behavior
    - Fix lagged penalty behavior
      (Use average sampled pixel value as penalty predictor)
    - Model based
        - Try running DreamerV2
    - Run a hyperparameter search
        - Different rollout sizes, seeds, penalty values, lagged vs immediate penalties, PPO vs DreamerV2

- Scaling (Work on as necessary when doing expirementation):
    - Options
        - AWS/GCP/Azure
            - Valuable skills
            - Getting quota has been hard so far
        - Vast.ai
            - Insecure
            - Need to handle possible host unreliability
            - Cheap
        - Local
            - Aim for high utilization of my machine i.e. queue multiple experiments (Listed under experiment setup section)
            - How hard is it to test experiment setups while other experiments are in progress?

- Give a write-up (Something relatively light)
    - Documentation
    - Short reflection (Below is probably too much)
        - Motivation
            - Wanted to re-create OpenAI Universe.
            - Wanted to either succeed in training an AI to play a game,
              or learn what the "blockers" were
        - Game choice
            - Wrote up a list
            - Initially chose Skyrogue
        - Harness
        - Many side-tracks
            - MC
            - Compression
            - ...
        - Return to the project
            - A better focus on engineering instead of research
        - Reward Fns
        - Time accel
        - RL
        - Future directions
            - Solve AOR single track (assuming search doesn't)
            - Solve other AOR tracks
            - Solve other games

        - Distill the story above into a clear narrative
            - Why I built
            - What I built
            - How I grew
            - What's the state of RL
