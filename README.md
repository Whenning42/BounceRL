# GameHarness

This is my long term project to explore developing Machine Learning agents to successfully play a variety of video games. It's inspired by OpenAI's Dota bot and Universe project and DeepMind's StarCraft bot.

This repo contains the following subprojects:
- A library for real-time GPU image stream compression. The source for this can be found in the "compression/" directory.
- A library for recording and controlling Linux applications. The source for this is spread throughout this project's directories, but the main file is "harness.py" in the root directory.
- A template matching based computer vision pipeline and workflow. The source for this can be found in "modeling/", "src/labels/", and "src/connected_components/" directories.
